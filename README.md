# Interactive Solar System Animation

An interactive 3D solar system animation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Realistic Planet Motion**: Planets orbit the sun with speeds proportional to their actual orbital periods
- **Relative Sizes & Distances**: Planets are sized and positioned with realistic relative proportions
- **Interactive Labels**: Click or hover over planets to see detailed information
- **Pause/Resume Controls**: Control the animation playback
- **Beautiful Visuals**: 
  - Dark space-themed background
  - Glowing sun with pulsing effect
  - Saturn with visible rings
  - Twinkling stars background
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the solar system
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and positioning
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity, animation controls, and dynamic information

## Planet Data

The animation includes all 8 planets with:

- Mercury (57.9 million km, 88 days)
- Venus (108.2 million km, 225 days) 
- Earth (149.6 million km, 365 days)
- Mars (227.9 million km, 687 days)
- Jupiter (778.5 million km, 12 years)
- Saturn (1.43 billion km, 29 years)
- Uranus (2.87 billion km, 84 years)
- Neptune (4.5 billion km, 165 years)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Watch planets orbit the sun automatically
3. Click or hover over any planet to see its details
4. Use the Pause/Resume buttons to control the animation

## Animation Speed

The orbital speeds are scaled down for visualization:
- 1 real day = 0.1 seconds of animation
- 1 real year = 12 seconds of animation

## Customization

You can easily customize:
- Planet colors in `script.js`
- Animation speeds in `style.css`
- Sizes and distances in `style.css`

## Browser Support

Works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with CSS animations support.
